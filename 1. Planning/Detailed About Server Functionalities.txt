		Math Recognizer
		Microsoft Paint
		Steps Recorder
		Windows Media Player
		Microsoft Edge
	3. These following features should be removed:
		Azure Arc Setup
		XPS Viewer
	4. Should use template-based deployment
		It can reduct the administration workloads.
		For detailed, please see commands and configuration in
			- "Install For Windows Template.ps1" - for scripting
			- "FunctionalCorServer_DeploymentConfigTemplate.xml" - Windows Server Core minimal functional features
			- "FunctionalGUIServer_DeploymentConfigTemplate.xml" - Windows Server GUI minimal functional features

* For Ubuntu Server
	1. Should only install Cockpit Web Interface for HV02
	2. SSH should block the authenticate with password when connecting (Only use certificate).

HV01:
	Act as the Hypervisor host (Type 1 - Bare metal) for operating system.
	For best operation, File Server with deduplication service is installed to reduce the cost and storage
	Note: The Hypervisor is not configured for backup service, so keep it running on minimal server features.

HV02:
	Act as the Hypervisor host (Type 1 - Bare metal) for operating system.
	Also handle backup service, as a NAS for incoming Windows Server environment
	Have a bare metal disk backup
	
DC01, DC02
